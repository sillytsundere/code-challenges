![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)

## Description

Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the integers between and including them and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!

## Examples

Examples (a, b) --> output (explanation)

`(1, 0) --> 1 (1 + 0 = 1)` </br>
`(1, 2) --> 3 (1 + 2 = 3)` </br>
`(0, 1) --> 1 (0 + 1 = 1)` </br>
`(1, 1) --> 1 (1 since both are same)` </br>
`(-1, 0) --> -1 (-1 + 0 = -1)` </br>
`(-1, 2) --> 2 (-1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2)`

Your function should only return a number, not the explanation about how you get that number.
